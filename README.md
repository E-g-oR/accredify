# Accredify

This is a SPA with React where a user can view their documents on the Home Page. A Managed User can see an additional “Career Goal” section on the Home Page.

In this project i tried to follow [FSD](https://feature-sliced.design/docs/get-started/overview) concepts for architecture to make it maintainable and scalable.
